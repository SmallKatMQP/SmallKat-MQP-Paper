%% Deliverables %%
% Describe the work to be done. Be specific and provide as many details as possible. Since it is likely not possible to accurately predict the time and resources needed to complete the work at this point, a statement of work should incorporate flexibility with regards to deliverable dates.

%% Constraints %%
% Identify any constraints that could affect the proposed work. For example, if you need a 1 mile closed-loop test track in order to verify the performance of your self-driving vehicle at highway speeds, you should state that as a constraint (unless you happen to have access to one). If you know you’ll need to purchase a $10K LIDAR to complete the project, note that.

%% Deliverables Schedule %%
% Provide a detailed list of specific outcomes and projected deadlines. As noted above, since it is not possible to accurately predict the time and resources needed to complete the work at this point, a statement of work should incorporate flexibility and indicate that the dates are projections based on current available information – not hard and fast commitments.


\section{Objectives}
SmallKat is designed to full a void in the research and development of multipedal robotic systems by providing researchers with a platform to design new gaits, test sensors and motors, and teach the next generation of engineers. Where-as the current options only allow for a limited number of robots due to cost,  size, complexity, and safety constraints, SmallKat will allow for organizations to have multiple development platforms running at  the  same time,  allowing  for comparisons of components and walking gaits.

To achieve this goal, SmallKat will be designed as an adaptable quadruped. Therefore, it must be highly modular and easily repairable. To allow for a multitude of different gaits, SmallKat will have four degrees-of-freedom (DoF) legs, differentiating it from the vast majority of other quadrupedal platforms. Each join twill be controlled by a powerful, but standard-sized hobby servo motor with additional sensors and components to allow for various forms of feedback: position, velocity, and torque. Finally, SmallKat will have triangulated pressure foot sensors for contact point detection, and several inertial measurement units (IMUs) for added control over the body's linear velocity and angular acceleration. This will all be tied together with an easily adaptable open source software platform that encourages smooth development and testing of the SmallKat robotics platform.

% Below is the stuff we wrote initially

% \subsection{Electrical Objectives}
% Develop a series of custom electronics and sensors including custom motors that provide feedback on torque, position and velocity as well as independent, tunable PID controllers for each of those running at 1kHz\+. A motherboard that is able to communicate between a computer and all sensor boards over USB HID. Configurable IMUs with integrated sensor fusion allowing to the request of a given type of data including Accelerometer, Gyroscope or Euler angles. Foot sensors combining 9 barometric pressure sensors to be encapsulated in a low durometer polyurethane allowing for a force vector to e calculated based on the readings of each sensor. 
% In combination with all of these sensors the system will be written in embedded C/C++ in order to ensure a reliable and fast system. All sensors will be able to be daisy chained via an SPI bus sharing the same chip select line passing data from one device to the next.
