The SmallKat MQP is providing a quadrupedal robotic platform intending to help research and design new gaits, test sensors, and teach engineering students. Currently available quadrupedal platforms limit small companies, universities, and hobbyists due to their complexity, large size, and immense cost. SmallKat plans to change that, by providing a low-cost robotic platform with customizability and adaptability in mind. To allow for a multitude of gait designs, it is designed with 4DoF legs controlled by powerful custom servo motors, 9DoF IMUs, and a custom micro controller. The body is constructed using additive manufacturing with PLA plastic, and has a continuum tail for added body control. The higher level controller runs on a single-board computer for added performance when computing kinematics and dynamics, and controlling different gaits. Future revisions of SmallKat could look to advance the basic gaits that were developed and add new sensors like a 3D camera.
