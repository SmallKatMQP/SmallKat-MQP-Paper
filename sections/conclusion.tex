\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

The project was overall a success despite the number of problems that arose through out the development of the system. A series of custom motors, sensors and accessory boards were successfully developed along with a custom communication protocol. Higher level kinematics and gait control was achieved using Bowler Studios for the implementation of the static walking gait along with the beginnings of a dynamic gait in Matlab and IHMC. The mechanical system resulted in a successful implementation of 4 DOF legs as well as a continuum tail used for dynamic balance. In end there is a great deal of work to be continued on the platform, including successfully integrating all the sensors, making a more robust communication structure and finalizing the tuning of the gaits and the overall system before testing and implementing the dynamics of the system fully. For future research and testing that should be done, there was a lack of information published about the advantages and disadvantages of using a 4DOF leg over a 3DOF leg in a quadruped.
% Should add the preliminary research found on 3 dof and 4 dof and explain more r esearch should be done here
